## Introduction

This repository contains TensorFlow implementation of the architecture from the ICML 2018 paper ["Learning Equations for Extrapolation and Control"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07259). This work proposes a neural network architecture for symbolic regression.

## Further developments (internal)

L0 regularization:

Go and install
python3 -m pip install --user git+https://gitlab.tuebingen.mpg.de/mrolinek/L0-regularization

python3 -m pip install --user numba sympy



## Usage

### Prepare data
Either provide a python function to 'learn' by calling
```
python3 data_utils.py "{'file_name': 'F1data', 'fn_to_learn': 'F1', 'train_val_examples': 10000, 'test_examples': 5000}"

```
or use your own numpy arrays saved in training/evaluation data files.

### Train individual model

Once the data is fixed train the model with
```
python3 train.py '{"train_val_file": "data/F1data_train_val", "test_file": "data/F1data_test"}'
```
Or possibly change some parameters with
```
python3 train.py '{"train_val_file": "data/F1data_train_val", "test_file": "data/F1data_test", "batch_size": 25}'
```

### Perform model selection

In case you want to follow the model selection procedure from the paper, first generate runfiles for all the required settings with
```
python3 createjobs.py '{"train_val_file": "data/F1data_train_val", "test_file": "data/F1data_test"}'
```

Then run all scripts in the jobs folder.

Finally the model selection is performed by

```
python3 model_selection.py "{'results_path': 'results/model_selection'}"
```

### Inspect the learned formulas

In each result folder one can find .png files with latex and graph representations of the learned formulas.
